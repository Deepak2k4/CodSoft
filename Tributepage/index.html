            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace
                scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in
                a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the
                next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be
                known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his
                    mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
                    between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.</li>
                <li>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors had been wealthy
                    Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a
                    Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders
                    and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the
                    island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With
                    the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the
                    family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
                    poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the
                    family's meager income. </li>
                <li>
                    In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.After
                    completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While
                    Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
                    threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
                    Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress
                    and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a
                    fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
